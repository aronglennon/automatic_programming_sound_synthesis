----------
Currently it is possible to mutate and simply swap the same object as we do not check what 'was' there before connection was cut. 
For everything but sfplay, this will result in something different since loadmess will get a new argument.

SIMILARITY TESTING:
For baseline, calc distances/similarities between all pairs of different files...since these are 'different', we can normalize by the difference as an extra point of analysis
when comparing metrics.
