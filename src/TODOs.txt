----------
Currently it is possible to mutate and simply swap the same object as we do not check what 'was' there before connection was cut. 
For everything but sfplay, this will result in something different since loadmess will get a new argument.

Where I am:
I'm not sure the create patch is updating the broken subpatch correctly, nor am I sure the best way to update the full patch.

TODO: 
1. update create patch to handle full, grow, and ramped half and half --> make sure that when we call this duration subpatch creation during mutation, we select grow...right?
2. determine how dynamic tree depth limits are actually increased over time
3. Make max portion work with multiple concurrent patches (in the same parent patcher)
4. disallow sfplay~...is this given special treatment in js??? if so, change if synthesis flag switched on
5. look at nonrealtime thing Adam sent


SIMILARITY TESTING:
For baseline, calc distances/similarities between all pairs of different files...since these are 'different', we can normalize by the difference as an extra point of analysis
when comparing metrics.
