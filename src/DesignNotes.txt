Root node of each tree is always a dac~

Connections are created moving 'up' the patch from sink (dac~) to source (adc~ or sfplay~). Therefore, on patch creation, 
we first connect an object to a dac~, then for every inlet that object has we create a new object to connect to it. When the 
tree depth is large enough, we may force only terminals (audio sources) to be used to connect to objects.

Connections are made between a patch's root and it's children nodes. Therefore, a patch's connection list provides
information containing each connection made from one of the patch's children to its root including the child's outlet
number, the root's inlet number, and the type of connection. During GA ops, it is important for syntactic correctness that
we are able to get a patch's output types and its input types (so we know where we can cross or what restraints there are on 
mutation). To get a patch's output types, one only need to ask every child what its root's output type is (since we only
allow one output type). To get a patch's input types, we need to ask every child what its possible root input types are (the
difference here being that each inlet may accept multiple types and all should be considered). The 'actual' connection types
are not important because once a connection is severed in a patch it may be the case that a different connection type will
replace it.
